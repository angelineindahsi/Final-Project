For my final project I am planning to make a hangman game, or a word guessing game. 
I am going to code with the things that I had learned during the introduction to programming class with the C++ language. 
In the game, the words that the player will have to guess will be random, and they will get hints such as how many words. 
If possible, I might also add hints that will make the player easier when they guess the word.
